This is a repo I'm using as I go through [The Haskell School of Music](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HSoM.pdf).

I am making it public in case it is of interest to anyone, and because the `stack.yaml` I made file seems to build Euterpea 2.

HSoM uses [Euterpea](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2), which is a neat music library for Haskell.
